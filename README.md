- 👋 Hi, I’m @necrocrunk
- 👀 I’m interested in : coding silly things for fun- mainly css/html/light java for webpages for fun. occasionally fixing minecraft mods for my friends servers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning : java... but it sucks so bad bro
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on : nothing currently :)
- 📫 How to reach me : oh please dont. turkin on neocities i guess but thats it


> i use this mostly to open issues or request help with certain things. im usually pretty good and troubleshooting myself but sometimes my brain just doesnt click like other peoples, especially considering i did mainly webpage design as a hobby and not like. javascript and minecraft lol
